# pixel-world-with-java-swing

This is a showcase of what Java Swing can do.

To move the player, press W (up), A (left), S (down), or D (right).

When the player enters a room, there will be a message in the terminal prompting the user of the action.

Have fun! I know it's only two rooms, but adding more is more than possible in the future.
